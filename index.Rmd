Hello! My name is Ekta Chaudhary. I'm a second-year _MPH-Epidemiology_ Candidate with a Certificate in _Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases_ at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Before Columbia, I earned a Bachelor of Dental Surgery from India which is equivalent to Doctor of Dental Surgery in the US. As a Dental Surgeon, I started with my venture and managed it independently for 5 years. I appointed, managed and led a team of 5 Dental specialists, 4 Dental Auxiliary staff, 5+ Interns to ensure the effective running of the dental operatory. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology. I am passionate about
working at the forefront of chronic disease prevention in areas such as cancer, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. You can learn more about my professional accomplishments [here](about.html).
I love photography, watching sunsets, exploring New York City.
